The production process for the pumps consists of three activities: assembly, painting, and testing (quality control), with their respective times listed in the table below. The profit contribution from selling a normal pump is 50, while a heavy-duty pump yields a profit of 75. There are 4800 hours available per week for assembly, 1980 hours for painting, and 900 hours for quality testing. Based on past experiences, the company expects to sell 300 normal pumps and 180 heavy-duty pumps. The manager is interested in determining the quantity of pumps to manufacture weekly in order to maximize profits."
