# Postwork 2 - Linear Regression Analysis

In this postwork assignment, you will be working on a linear regression problem using the provided Jupyter notebook, Minicase2.ipynb. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of performing a linear regression analysis and building a linear regression model.

To complete this assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Open the Minicase2.ipynb notebook

2. Read the problem statement and instructions provided in the notebook.

3. Complete the missing code cells and fill in the necessary details.

4. Execute the code cells to perform the required calculations and generate the desired outputs.

## Step 2: Test and Validate Your Solution

1. Once you have completed all the code cells in the notebook, run the entire notebook to ensure that all the code is executing correctly and producing the expected results.

2. Verify the output, check for any errors, and make necessary corrections if required.

3. Double-check that you have included all the required visualizations, tables, and any additional outputs as mentioned in the instructions.

## Step 3: Submit Your Work

1. After successfully completing the notebook, save the final version.

2. Create a new repository on GitHub (if you don't have one already) to host your work.

3. Push the local repository, including the Minicase2.ipynb notebook and any other necessary files, to the remote repository on GitHub.

4. Finally, submit the URL of your GitHub repository in the Canvas assignment submission area to ensure your work is properly submitted.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to follow the instructions in the notebook carefully and provide any required answers or explanations in the designated markdown cells.

- Remember to adhere to best practices in coding, including proper formatting, commenting, and using meaningful variable names.

Good luck with your analysis! Feel free to explore and experiment with different techniques and approaches to enhance your understanding of linear regression.
